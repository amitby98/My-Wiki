        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2>Who I Am?</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Amit, I am 23 years old and I am the owner of the
          studio.<br />
          I did a lot of sports and realized that the mind is no less important
          than<br />
          the body so I went to study yoga and today I have a yoga coach
          certificate.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Coaches:</h2>
        <p>
          Our dream team has four yoga coaches: Michelle, Tom, Jennifer, and
          David.<br />
          They are instructors with a lot of good energy and everyone has
          certificates.
        </p>
        <h2>Meaning of the name:</h2>
        <p>
          Vinyasa is a breath initiated practice, that connects every action of
          our life<br />
          with the intention of moving towards what is sacred, or most important
          to us.<br />
          That׳s why I chose this name.
        </p>
        <h2>Location:</h2>
        <p>
          Our studio is located in New York, <br />
          Currently because of the corona virus classes are taking place online.
